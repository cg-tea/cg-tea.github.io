I hope to fill it with useful stuff soon. It may be very messy in the meantime, expect some placeholder pages.</p> <p>In addition to the nonsense I'll be plopping here, I hope some friends will soon start to join me in this small adventure, sharing their own discoveries and, more likely, rants (you have no idea how far down the vellum rabbit hole some people can dig while still being able to walk home at the end of the day).</p> tl;dr <p>i'm on vacation and bored</p> <p>Hope you'll find something useful!</p>"},{"location":"#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Giacomo Balma</p> <p>Made with Material for MkDocs</p>"},{"location":"houdini/cam_cull/","title":"Coming soon","text":"<p>This page is wip  </p>"},{"location":"houdini/somevex/","title":"A little bit of this, a little bit of vex","text":"<p>Scrippity dobbity doup</p> <p>This page is a wip</p>"},{"location":"katana/somelua/","title":"Coming Soon","text":"<p>Not there yet, but probably Giacomo complaining about lua and camera culling.</p>"},{"location":"katana/somelua/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>This is a Lorem Ipsum, but I'll still use this to spam the katana man: stefanmuller.com</p>"}]}
