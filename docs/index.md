# Welcome to CG Tea, don't mind if i spill some :heart:
A place for TDs, CG and VFX artists to share and find ideas.  

## Introduction and motivations
Hey there!

This website - which one day may actually be worthy of the "wiki" label - was created to collect some personal RnDs, notes and more-or-less useful things I discovered or that I was introduced to by friends and colleagues.  
I often find myself checking whether someone already did something to solve the same problem I'm dealing with. I feel that's always a very good time investment, no matter if the reaction I have after finding out is `oh jees I'm dumb` or `mmmh I see, I may do something different though`.

Inspired by [tokeru](https://tokeru.com/cgwiki) and other cool websites that were (more or less) born with the same principle in mind, I hope this big hotpot may eventually be useful to people that find themselves banging their head against the same wall I had the pleasure to bonk already.

The contents of this wiki will be various: you'll find DCC specific stuff (Houdini mainly), but also concepts that are common to the CG and VFX universe as a whole.  

Long story short, this is an online notebook, be aware that the quality of what's posted here will very likely depend on the mental status of the person writing in that moment.

!!! warning
    At the moment the website is under construction, I'm still trying to figure out how GitHub Pages work. I hope to fill it with useful stuff soon.  
    It may be very messy in the meantime (or maybe not?)

In addition to the nonsense I'll be plopping here, I hope some friends will soon start to join me in this small adventure, sharing their own discoveries and, more likely, rants (you have no idea how far down the vellum rabbit hole some people can dig while still being able to walk home at the end of the day).

???- abstract "tl;dr"
    i'm on vacation and bored

Hope you'll find something useful!
